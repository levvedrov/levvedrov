## 🚀 About Me

I am a computer science undergraduate with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, system-level programming, and applied computing. With hands-on experience in real-world projects — from industrial automation to full-stack web platforms — I strive to solve meaningful problems using code. My journey began at age 10 with C/C++, and it has led me to develop solutions for educational systems, intelligent devices, and research-based AI models.
